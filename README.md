Creating a QR code generator using HTML 📄, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript 💻 involves designing a simple interface where users can input data and generate a QR code using an API. HTML provides the structure with input fields and a button, CSS styles these elements for a clean and user-friendly interface, and JavaScript handles the interaction with the QR code generation API, updating the interface to display the generated QR code dynamically. This combination allows users to easily create and view QR codes. 🚀
